LXI D, 1100H     ; Load address of the vector (lower byte) into DE
MVI A, 04H       ; Set the counter to the number of bytes in the vector
MOV C, A        ; Load accumulator into register C as the loop counter
MOV B, M        ; Set register B to the initial value, which is the first byte in the vector
INX H           ; Increment HL to point to the next byte in the vector

MINFIND: MOV A, M    ; Move content of memory location pointed by DE to A
        INX D       ; Increment DE to point to the next byte in the vector
        CMP B       ; Compare content of B with the current minimum value

        MOV B, A    ; Move content of A to B (as it's smaller)
        MOV D, H    ; Update register DE to point to the current byte in the vector
        MOV E, L
SKIP:   DCR C       ; Decrement counter to move to the next byte in the vector
        JNZ MINFIND ; If counter is not zero, loop back to compare the next bytes

; Here, the value in register B is the minimum value found in the vector, and
; register DE contains the address of the last vector element that was checked.
